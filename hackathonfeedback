The idea for the project is very nice, relevant and important.
We must not forget our fallen brothers and sisters.
Lets first talk about style and layout.
The heros cards are a nice size, visually appealing and clear.
The search functionality is fantastic too.
When you search and there are no heros returned, it would be best to notify the user with some sort of text
on the screen. Also notice how the "submit your hero" button goes all the way up instead of staying at the bottom.
When you are searching maybe its also best to do a circular loading animation so the user knows you are searching, 
maybe the loading animation can also be on the main screen when fetching the heros too .
I would maybe also utilise a fade in animation for the cards to add some extra smoothness.
The submit hero form is a great addition , as I saw in the example you submitted you had to press multiple times to be 
redirected. I would fix that and also maybe send the user a message "Thanks for submitting , we will review your post ...".
The admin panel is a great idea too. I would make this specifically password protected as it seems like there is 
nothing stopping the rest of the users of going there too.
Code structure is overall good. Routes , controllers and models.
Excellent job utilising the image upload!!
